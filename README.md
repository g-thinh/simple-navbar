# The Simple Nav Bar

Available here: https://simple-navbar.vercel.app/

This is my attempt at creating a nav bar component with the scrolling behaviour seen in persistent navigation as described in [Material.io](https://material.io/components/app-bars-top).

Added some lorem ipsum cards to browse and see the increase in elevation while scrolling, also threw in a sidedrawer for mobile and non-mobile displays!

Controlling UI regions with CSS Grids was not easy but definitely achievable. I would definitely recommend using this amazing [app](https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app/) created by [Sarah Dresner](https://github.com/sdras) to figure those tricky layouts!
